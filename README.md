1. The dataset is from lending club official site. (https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)  
2. These files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period stated, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. The file containing loan data through the "present" contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter.  
3. I choose 2016Q1 since this will let the loan more time to develop. If you compare with 2018Q1 data, you will find that most of the 2018Q1 data is under 'current' category because these loans are just issued.
4. There is another LCDataDictionary.xlsx file on the website to explain each feature in the data set.
